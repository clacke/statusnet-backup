Various bugs/problems/tasks that I need to fix… things I can't fix easily will become known issues.

 * Take Atom backup files and generate HTML
 * Subscriptions feed does not work—missing georss namespace on XML (StatusNet bug)
 * Make script exit properly when pages no longer exist. Happens for all stream types. StatusNet should return a 404, and requests should not return 'OK' for the request—but something along this chain does. Why?
